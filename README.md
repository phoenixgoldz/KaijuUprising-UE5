# Kaiju Uprising

**Kaiju Uprising** is a third-person mech combat game built in **Unreal Engine 5.6**, where players pilot customizable **Titan Mechs** to battle massive Kaiju in large-scale, high-impact encounters.

Players collect Kaiju parts after battle and use them to upgrade and customize their Titan Mech, creating a replayable progression system inspired by Monster Hunter–style tech trees.
